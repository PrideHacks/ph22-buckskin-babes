                <h3>Autumn Godwin, Montreal Lake Cree Nation</h3>
                <p>Urban Indigenous peoples, sharing and disseminating this research is one of the ways in which she sees herself as facilitating the process of decolonization. In addition to her academic work, Autumn works for several community organisations that support the Indigenous community in Montreal. </p>

                <p>Autumn is a co-founder of the Buckskin Babes urban moose hiding tanning collective. Central to this project was an effort to facilitate reconnection to the land, land-based practices and the traditional knowledge teachings that would otherwise have been passed on by community Elders, for the Urban Indigenous Community here  in <strong>Tiohtià:ke</strong>. </p>

                <p>What she discovered was that not only was valuable knowledge shared, but that this process ignited community and individual healing through the creation of deep and meaningful connections. It also allowed for the creation of space for other Indigenous individuals who did not have that connection to the land and its teachings due to colonial policies.

I am Snipe clan of the Kanien’kehà:ka nation, born and raised in Kahnawà:ke. Iam currently enrolled in the Master of Arts Individualized Program at Concordia University where I hope to create experiential learning, youth mentorship in the community based on cosmological kinship systems, language, and land. I envision an environment that nourishes our gifts, the gifts our ancestors left us. </p>

                <p>My previous studies in <strong>Ratiwennahní:rats</strong> , a Kanien’kéha language immersion program has helped to build my identity and a foundation deeply rooted in tsi niionkwariho:ten. I am passionate about learning the language of the land and tapping into ancestral blood memory while weaving my web of kinnections across Turtle Island. Being an energetic snipe, I love hanging out with my family and friends, eating scrumptious foods, foraging, learning, planting, seed saving and hunting.

                <p>Dayna Danger (they/them) is a Two-Spirit, Indigiqueer, Métis-Saulteaux-Polish, visual artist, hide tanner, drummer, and beadworker. Danger’s art practice is an act of reclaiming space and power over society's projections of sexualities and representation. This transpires in Danger’s art by their intentionally large-scale images that place importance on women-identified, Two-Spirit, transgender, and non-binary people. </p>

                <p>Their art uses symbolic references to kink communities to critically interrogate visibility and rejection. Danger centres Kin and practises of consent to build artworks that create a suspension of reality wherein complex dynamics of sexuality, gender, and power are exchanged.
